# machineLearningAssignments

Assignments for UVa's CS 4501 Machine Learning course. Notably, these implementations are typically "from scratch" and thus demonstrate how to implement various learning tasks without the use of third party libraries like scikit. The neural network assignment is an exception to this as it uses the popular Keras machine learning library.
